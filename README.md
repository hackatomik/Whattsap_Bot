# WhatsApp Bot.
**Bot en desarrollo**
# Objective of the bot.
*The objective of the bot is to integrate an AI that is managed by controllers that we are going to implement in the backend in such a way that it gives a more human attention and that the iteration is personalized and not just a bot that only answers messages with options or that only answers text messages with predefined messages, then the objective is to avoid that the user is feeling that he is interacting with a bot, but that they feel that they are interacting with a person and feel that they are having a personal and comfortable attention that is providing and recommending and covering their needs or requirements in such a way that if the customer is decided to make a purchase or acquire a product the AI immediately sends a notification to the person and warns him that we have a potential buyer that requires attention from a person who is responsible for serving the customer and ask for the necessary data to be able to make the closing of the purchase / sale, we want to avoid that the data of the users that interact with the BotIA are stored in the database and this to maintain security and privacy of users. *
